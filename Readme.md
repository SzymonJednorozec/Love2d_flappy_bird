### Description
My game is a version of Flappy Bird with additions, where the player jumps using the recoil from a weapon. Every few seconds, besides the obstacles that must be avoided, waves of enemies also appear.

The game features 7 difficulty levels, which affect:
- The distance between obstacles
- The number of enemies
- The speed of enemies
- The value of the coins

I also added several mechanics, such as:
- Coins that can be destroyed by enemies and obstacles
- The ability to destroy obstacles to create more space to deal with enemies

For the game, I used hand-made sprites, a background image generated by ChatGPT, and sounds from freesound.org.
I also used Lua libraries such as **vector**, **timer**, and **HC** for handling vectors, timing events, and collision detection respectively.

While creating the game, I used ChatGPT for finding and fixing bugs when something wasn't working.
